# Q-Digest Parallel Implementation
This is a test `README` for the HPC project.

## Workflow
1. Whenever you want to add something, open your branch using `git checkout -b <author>/<feature>`
2. Open a pull request as soon as you start working, that way everyone can monitor what you are working on at the moment.
3. Once you are done, test that everything works and (possibly) ask for a review before merging into main.
4. If everything works as expected, accept pull request and merge into main, otherwise review your work and resubmit for later.
